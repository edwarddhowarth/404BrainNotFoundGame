Thank you for purchasing the Sci Fi Cityscape package. 

This package uses linear color space (Edit->Project Settings->Player->Color Space) and the deferred render path (Edit->Project Settings->Graphics->Rendering Path). Please change your project settings accordingly.

In the Update function of the UIKeys.cs and the ThemeManager.cs you find the values for the individual theme settings. If you want to make a setting permanent copy these values to the corresponding fields in the editor.

If you have any further questions don't hesitate to contact us: info@triplebrick.com

Cheers
